The project is run in the main method of BayesianNet. You should input either "exact", "rejection", or "likelihood" (sans quotations), then the number of samples to be used, only if it's an approximate inference. After that, write the XMLBIF filename, the name of the query variable, and then the name of each evidence variable and its corresponding value. From there, the program will run an exact inference, rejection sampling, or likelihood sampling on the problem and will print out the results. The parser is a version of the given parser, modified to fit my code, but with essentially the same structure.
