The project is run in the main method of LinearClassifier. You should input a p if you want to run the perceptron classifier, or an l if you want to run the logistic classifier. After that, write the filename, and either a 0 if you want to use a decaying learning rate, or a 1 if you want to use a constant learning rate. From there on, the program will run the classifier of choice on the given file, with the given learning rate, and will print out the accuracy for each step in the training.
